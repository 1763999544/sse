# Server-Sent Events (SSE)

Сlients subscribe to aт events source on a server. If the server has new data, it sends a response to all subscribed clients. It’s possible for the server to close connection and stop events sending as well as for a client to stop events listening. SSE is a one-directional protocol where data can be sent only from server to client.
